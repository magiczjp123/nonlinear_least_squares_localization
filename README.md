## nonlinear_least_squares_localization  
  
This repo realize a algorithm that uses nonlinear least squares problem optimization to solve localization optimization for robot. Since robots movement tradjectory contains noises and these has been a range of solutions namely SLAM, EKF. Solving nonlinear least square problem could also be a sulotion.  
This repo will be programed by python, based on my matlab work at uni. Will include random robot trajectory generation, optimization process and result plot.
